# Web APIs Challenge 04: Code Quiz

I was tasked this week with building a coding quiz.  This challenge helped in getting me more familiar with HTML, CSS and most of all JavaScript.  This quiz has content on JavaScript fundamentals.  It is 90 seconds long and has 10 questions. 

Criteria

* Start the quiz when start button is 'clicked'.
* When button is clicked, a question appears with multiple choice answers and a timer starts at 90 seconds and counts down.
* When the answer button is clicked, it quicly displays "Correct" or "Wrong" and moves on to the next question.
* When a question is answered correctly it adds 10 seconds to the timer and when it is answered incorrectly it subtracts 10 seconds from the timer. 
* When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the quiz is over.
* The user is shown his or her score and prompted to enter their initials.
* Then he or she is shown the High Scores and asked to clear them or take the quiz again.
